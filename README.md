# ECG-Signal-Analysis
This MATLAB project implements signal processing techniques to enhance and analyze noisy ECG signals. By employing filtering, detrending, and peak detection methods, the code isolates essential cardiac features, calculates heart rate, and provides a cleaner representation of the ECG for diagnostic purposes.
